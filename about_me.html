        <p>
            I'm born and raised in Brazil, for me it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, the food here is amazing, the people are very kind, of course we have some problems but I love my country. My main goal as a human being, is to be a Jesus copy, be as similar as possible like Him.

        <h2 align="center">Hobby</h2>
        <p>
            One of my favorite hobbies is running, it's an activity that makes me connect with myself, pushes me to the limit and I feel like it helps me to improve my ability to be consistent, as I make a commitment to myself to run at least three times a week.
